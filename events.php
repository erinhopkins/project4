Please come out to this event if you can, its for a great cause. Feel free to also bring any physical gifts you can donate to Toys for Tots, as there will be a truck there collecting them. As a bonus, all member of the UCF Pokémon Club who come out and walk a minimum of 3 miles will recieve a free semester of club dues.

							<h2 class="events-h2">Unification for the Spring Semester Revolt [USSR] (01/22/2019)</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="post-content">
							Two weeks after the sping 2019 semester begins we will be holding a unification rally between our club and the other gaming related clubs on campus. Our objective is to gain awarness for all gaming related incidents that happen on campus as a result of there being a lack of UCF admmistrative regulations in place protecting our rights to game freely. Incidents such as a power surges destroying ones console because of faulty electrical wiring in the old UCF buildings, or even a tree running into a Nintendo Switch player because it's never the other way around, it's always the trees fault. Why would UCF landscaping put a tree right in the middle of a premium gaming location? Neither of these horrfic tragedies should ever happen to a gamer. We will stand against the naysayers who claim that we contribute nothing to the campus as a whole. <span class="span1">We will Unionize, we will mobolize, &amp; we will terrorize</span> all who stand between us and our goal. 
							<br />
							Come rally together on the 22nd of February ready to march on Millican Hall, armed with your First Amendment Rights and your cellphones, so that you can record all of it and post it on the internet later. Dont forget to use #gamersToo and #RiseUpGamers when posting to social media. 
							
							<br />
							<br />
							
							<span class="span2">This is a no violence &amp; no hostility rally. Those who oppose the peace will be forcibly removed and prosecuted within the legal confines of the law.</span>
